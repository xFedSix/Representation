					A guide to writing maintainable, flexible, and scalable software
				</p>

				<section>
					<h2>S - Single Responsibility Principle</h2>
					<p>A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Example of SRP</h3>
					<p>
						Consider a class <code>UserManager</code> that has methods for user
						management tasks such as adding or removing users, and also methods
						for user notifications like sending emails. This class violates SRP
						because it has more than one reason to change: changes to user
						management logic or changes to how notifications are handled.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<pre>
						<code class="language-js">
							class UserManager {
								addUser(user) { /* ... */ }
								removeUser(user) { /* ... */ }
								sendEmail(user, message) { /* ... */ }
							}
						</code>
					</pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>SRP-Compliant Solution</h3>
					<p>
						To adhere to SRP, we can split <code>UserManager</code> into two
						classes: one for user management and another for user notifications.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<pre>
						<code class="language-js">
							class UserManager {
								addUser(user) { /* ... */ }
								removeUser(user) { /* ... */ }
							}
							class UserNotifier {
								sendEmail(user, message) { /* ... */ }
							}
						</code>
					</pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Conclusion on SRP</h3>
					<p>
						By following the Single Responsibility Principle, we ensure that
						each class in our system has a single responsibility and thus only
						one reason to change. This makes our system more robust, easier to
						maintain, and enhances its ability to adapt to future requirements.

					<h2>O - Open/Closed Principle</h2>
					<p>
						Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for
						modification.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>What is the Open/Closed Principle?</h3>
					<p>
						The Open/Closed Principle is a fundamental concept in
						object-oriented design that suggests software entities (classes,
						modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed
						for modification. This means you should be able to add new
						functionality without changing the existing code.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Why is OCP Important?</h3>
					<p>
						Following the Open/Closed Principle helps in reducing the risk of
						breaking existing functionality when making changes or adding new
						features. It encourages a more modular design, promotes reusability,
						and leads to more maintainable and scalable code.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Example Violating OCP</h3>
					<p>
						Imagine a class <code>ReportGenerator</code> that generates reports
						in a specific format (e.g., PDF). If you need to support new formats
						(e.g., HTML), you have to modify the
						<code>ReportGenerator</code> class. This approach violates OCP.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<pre>
						<code class="language-js">
							class ReportGenerator {
								generateReport(data) {
								// Generate a PDF report
								}
							}
						</code>
					</pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>OCP-Compliant Solution</h3>
					<p>
						To comply with OCP, you can define a common interface for report
						generation and implement it for each report format. This way,
						supporting new formats doesn't require changing the existing code,
						only extending it.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<pre>
						<code class="language-js" style="min-height: 500px;">
							interface ReportGenerator {
								generateReport(data);
							}
							class PdfReportGenerator implements ReportGenerator {
								generateReport(data) {
									// Generate a PDF report
								}
							}
							class HtmlReportGenerator implements ReportGenerator {
								generateReport(data) {
									// Generate an HTML report
								}
							}
						</code>
					</pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Applying OCP in Practice</h3>
					<p>
						To effectively apply the Open/Closed Principle, focus on identifying
						aspects of your application that are most likely to change. Abstract
						these aspects behind stable interfaces, and implement functionality
						as extensions of these interfaces.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Conclusion on OCP</h3>
					<p>
						By adhering to the Open/Closed Principle, developers can create
						systems that are more flexible and easier to update or extend over
						time. This principle is crucial for achieving a scalable and
						maintainable codebase that can adapt to new requirements without
						compromising existing functionality.

					<h2>L - Liskov Substitution Principle</h2>
					<p>
						Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their
						subtypes without altering the correctness of the program.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>What is the Liskov Substitution Principle?</h3>
					<p>
						The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) is a concept in
						object-oriented programming that states if S is a subtype of T, then
						objects of type T in a program may be replaced with objects of type
						S without altering any of the desirable properties of that program
						(correctness, task performed, etc.).
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Why is LSP Important?</h3>
					<p>
						LSP is crucial for the maintainability and reusability of code. It
						ensures that a subclass can stand in for its superclass without
						errors. If a subclass cannot be used in place of its superclass,
						then the design violates LSP and is likely to be error-prone and
						difficult to maintain.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Example Violating LSP</h3>
					<p>
						Consider a class <code>Rectangle</code> with methods
						<code>setWidth</code> and <code>setHeight</code>. A subclass
						<code>Square</code> overrides these methods because for a square,
						width and height are always equal. This violates LSP because a
						<code>Square</code> cannot be used as a
						<code>Rectangle</code> without altering the behavior of
						<code>Rectangle</code>.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<pre>
						<code class="language-js" style="min-height: 500px;">
							class Rectangle {
								setWidth(width) { /* ... */ }
								setHeight(height) { /* ... */ }
							}
							class Square extends Rectangle {
								setWidth(width) {
									super.setWidth(width);
									super.setHeight(width);
								}
								setHeight(height) {
									super.setWidth(height);
									super.setHeight(height);
								}
							}
				</code></pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>LSP-Compliant Solution</h3>
					<p>
						To comply with LSP, instead of inheriting <code>Square</code> from
						<code>Rectangle</code>, both can implement a more general interface
						or have a more abstract parent class that does not assume the
						relationship between width and height.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<pre>
						<code class="language-js" style="min-height: 500px;">
							interface Shape {
								setWidth(width);
								setHeight(height);
							}
							class Rectangle implements Shape {
								setWidth(width) { /* ... */ }
								setHeight(height) { /* ... */ }
							}
							class Square implements Shape {
								setSize(size) {
									// Set both width and height to size
								}
							}
						</code>
					</pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Applying LSP in Practice</h3>
					<p>
						When designing your classes and their relationships, ensure that any
						subclass can replace its superclass without affecting the program's
						execution. This might involve rethinking inheritance hierarchies and
						favoring composition over inheritance where necessary.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Conclusion on LSP</h3>
					<p>
						Adhering to the Liskov Substitution Principle is essential for
						creating flexible and maintainable object-oriented systems. It
						encourages a design where subclasses can be used interchangeably
						with their superclasses, leading to more robust and reliable code.

					<h2>I - Interface Segregation Principle</h2>
					<p>
						No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>What is the Interface Segregation Principle?</h3>
					<p>
						The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) is a design principle in
						object-oriented programming that states clients should not be forced
						to depend upon interfaces they do not use. This principle aims to
						reduce the side effects and frequency of required changes by
						splitting large interfaces into smaller and more specific ones so
						that clients only need to know about the methods that are of
						interest to them.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Why is ISP Important?</h3>
					<p>
						ISP helps in making the system more modular, easier to understand
						and maintain. It reduces the impact of changes, as changes to one
						part of the system will not affect those parts that don't depend on
						it. This principle also promotes a more decoupled system where
						components can be developed, tested, and updated more independently.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Example Violating ISP</h3>
					<p>
						Imagine an interface <code>Workable</code> that has methods for
						different types of work, such as <code>work</code>,
						<code>eat</code>, and <code>sleep</code>. A class
						<code>Human</code> might implement all these methods, but a class
						<code>Robot</code> would only implement <code>work</code>, making
						the <code>Robot</code> class dependent on methods it does not use.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<pre><code class="language-js" style="min-height: 500px;">
							interface Workable {
								work();
								eat();
								sleep();
							}
							class Human implements Workable {
								work() { /* ... */ }
								eat() { /* ... */ }
								sleep() { /* ... */ }
							}
							class Robot implements Workable {
								work() { /* ... */ }
								eat() { // Not applicable }
								sleep() { // Not applicable }
							}
						</code></pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>ISP-Compliant Solution</h3>
					<p>
						To adhere to ISP, we can split the <code>Workable</code> interface
						into smaller interfaces, such as <code>Workable</code>,
						<code>Eatable</code>, and <code>Sleepable</code>. This way,
						<code>Human</code> can implement all three interfaces, while
						<code>Robot</code> only implements <code>Workable</code>.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<pre><code class="language-js" style="min-height: 500px;">
							interface Workable {
								work();
							}
							interface Eatable {
								eat();
							}
							interface Sleepable {
								sleep();
							}
							class Human implements Workable, Eatable, Sleepable {
								work() { /* ... */ }
								eat() { /* ... */ }
								sleep() { /* ... */ }
							}
							class Robot implements Workable {
								work() { /* ... */ }
							}
						</code>
						</pre>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Applying ISP in Practice</h3>
					<p>
						When designing interfaces, consider the clients that will use them.
						Aim for lean interfaces that are client-specific rather than
						general-purpose. This approach minimizes the impact of changes and
						makes your code more adaptable and easier to refactor.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Conclusion on ISP</h3>
					<p>
						By following the Interface Segregation Principle, developers can
						create systems that are more flexible, maintainable, and
						understandable. It encourages designing interfaces that are specific
						to the client's needs, thereby reducing unnecessary dependencies and
						making the system more robust against changes.

					<h2>D - Dependency Inversion Principle</h2>
					<p>
						High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both
						should depend on abstractions.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>What is the Dependency Inversion Principle?</h3>
					<p>
						The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) is a fundamental principle
						in object-oriented design that suggests high-level modules should
						not depend on low-level modules, but both should depend on
						abstractions. Additionally, abstractions should not depend on
						details, but details should depend on abstractions. This principle
						aims to decouple software modules, making them more reusable and
						maintainable.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Why is DIP Important?</h3>
					<p>
						DIP is crucial for reducing the coupling between code modules,
						making a system easier to refactor, test, and maintain. By depending
						on abstractions rather than concrete implementations, software
						components become more flexible and adaptable to change. This
						principle is key to achieving a scalable and robust architecture.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Example Violating DIP</h3>
					<p>
						Consider a high-level module <code>OrderProcessor</code> that
						directly depends on a low-level module <code>EmailService</code> to
						send confirmation emails. This direct dependency makes it hard to
						change or test <code>OrderProcessor</code> without also involving
						<code>EmailService</code>.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<pre>
						<code class="language-js" style="min-height: 500px;">
							class EmailService {
								sendEmail(orderId, email) {
									// Send email logic
								}
							}
							class OrderProcessor {
								constructor() {
									this.emailService = new EmailService();
							}
								processOrder(orderId, email) {
									// Order processing logic
									this.emailService.sendEmail(orderId, email);
								}
							}
						</code>
					</pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>DIP-Compliant Solution</h3>
					<p>
						To adhere to DIP, introduce an abstraction (e.g., an interface or an
						abstract class) for <code>EmailService</code> and depend on this
						abstraction in <code>OrderProcessor</code>. This way,
						<code>OrderProcessor</code> is decoupled from the concrete
						implementation of email sending, making it more flexible and easier
						to test.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
						<pre>
							<code class="language-js" style="min-height: 500px;">
								interface IEmailService {
									sendEmail(orderId, email);
								}
								class EmailService implements IEmailService {
									sendEmail(orderId, email) {
										// Send email logic
									}
								}
								class OrderProcessor {
									constructor(emailService: IEmailService) {
										this.emailService = emailService;
									}
									processOrder(orderId, email) {
										// Order processing logic
										this.emailService.sendEmail(orderId, email);
									}
								}
						</code>
					</pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Applying DIP in Practice</h3>
					<p>
						When designing your system, always aim to depend on abstractions
						rather than concrete classes. Use dependency injection to provide
						the concrete implementations at runtime. This approach not only
						makes your code more modular and testable but also aligns with the
						principles of clean architecture.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Conclusion on DIP</h3>
					<p>
						Following the Dependency Inversion Principle helps in creating a
						system that is decoupled, flexible, and easy to maintain. It
						encourages the development of a system where high-level modules are
						insulated from the changes in low-level modules, leading to a more
						robust and adaptable codebase.
